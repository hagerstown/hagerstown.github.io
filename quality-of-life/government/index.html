    <h1>Town Government</h1>
<h2>Town Council</h2>
<p>The Town Council is the legislative and executive body of the town, composed of five members. Each member serves a four year term. Elections are staggered so as to prevent an all new council in any given year.</p>
<h2>Town Manager</h2>
<p>The town manager is the administrative head of town management, and may exercise limited executive powers. The Manager is hired by the Town Council and works on a contractual basis to oversee the daily functions of the town.</p>
<h2>Clerk-Treasurer</h2>
<p>The Clerk-Treasurer is the fiscal officer of the town. It is an elected, four-year term of office. Duties include record maintenance, collecting and dispersing monies, maintaining financial records, recording town council proceedings, and issuing licenses.</p>
<h2>Police</h2>
<p>The Hagerstown Police operate under a town marshal system, as defined by Indiana law. The Marshal is appointed by the Town Council and reports to the Town Council President. There are five full-time police officers on the Hagerstown Police force, all have completed police academy training. The police department has two fully marked and equipped patrol vehicles and a “back up” car which can easily be converted for duty.</p>
<h2>Fire</h2>
<p>Hagerstown’s fire service is provided by a volunteer fire department. The fire station is located near downtown and the other public buildings. The fire department has <span class="proof"><strong><strong><em>_</em></strong></strong></span> equipment, and provides service earning a <span class="proof"><strong>_</strong>ISO</span> rating.</p>
<h2>Plan Commission</h2>
<p>The Plan Commission is the planning and zoning advisory board for the town. The Plan Commission has seven members. Three of the Plan Commission members are from town government, and four are appointed citizen members, no more than two of whom may be from the same political party. Citizen members are appointed to four year terms. The Plan Commission meets the third Wednesday of each month.</p>
<h2>Board of Zoning Appeals</h2>
<p>The BZA is a five member board who meets to hear requests for appeal or variance from the zoning regulations as well as make other planning related decisions. Three of the Board members are citizens appointed by the Town Council President, one of whom must be a member of the Plan Commission. One citizen member is appointed by the Town Council, and the other is appointed by the Plan Commission. The member appointed by the Plan Commission and one other member must be residents of the unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of Hagerstown zoning law.</p>
