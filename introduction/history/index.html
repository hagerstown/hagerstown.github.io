    <h1>History</h1>
<p>The first European settler to the Nettle Creek area was Sam Baldridge in 1814. Following his arrival, several families began to settle in the area. A church, Salem Baptist, was established in 1816, and the Church of the Brethren was organized nine years later. The first school in the area was organized northeast of what is now Hagerstown in 1828. A post office was established at Nettle Creek in 1829.</p>
<p>The area was platted as a town on March 8, 1832 by Jacob Ulrich and Jonas Harris as a real estate venture. The area was given the name of Elizabethtown after Ulrich’s daughter, but was soon changed to Hagerstown in honor of the Maryland town where many of the settlers originated. The plat was officially recorded at the state capitol at Corydon on November 15, 1832. The resolution for Hagerstown to be incorporated as a town was not passed until September 3, 1853.</p>

<p>The town faced several changes as it grew in the 19th century. By 1832 a number of businesses and mills had been established. A new post office was built at Nettle Creek in 1833, and the name officially changed to Hagerstown in 1836. The Hagerstown Canal Company was organized in 1846, with Jacob Ulrich as president. Two schools were organized for the 1846-47 school year. The earliest newspaper, the <em>Western Budget</em>, was established in 1852. A second paper, the <em>Hagerstown Journal</em>, began publication in 1865, but did not survive. The <em>Hagerstown Exponent</em> was established in 1875 by Alonzo Milton Dawson, who sold it two years later. <span class="proof">The Hagerstown Exponent remains the source of local news for the Hagerstown area</span>. In 1860 a brick school named the Hagerstown Academy was built as a permanent site for community education. A circulating library was established in 1863 in the basement of Watkin William’s Tailor Shop.</p>
<p>No history of Hagerstown would be complete without the story of the Teetor family and Perfect Circle. In 1895, Charlie Teetor changed his family bicycle repair shop to the Railway Cycle Manufacturing Company after developing a lightweight four-wheeled pedal railroad car with financing from Charles Hartley. The company began manufacturing self-propelled inspection cars and in 1900 changed names to the Light Inspection Car Company. The company took advantage of the Midwest’s movement toward automobile manufacture and began producing car engines and engine parts, including pistons and piston rings. In 1907, the company began casting the piston rings individually, creating a superior quality product. The piston rings became popular quickly, and the company changed its main production to piston rings, changing the company name to the Teetor-Hartley Motor Company and adopting the trade name of Perfect Circle.</p>
<p>The Hagerstown Telephone Company was established in 1899. The early 1900’s brought other changes in technology to Hagerstown as well. Electricity was provided in 1908, and a municipal water system was adopted in 1909.</p>
<p>The Hagerstown and Jefferson Township schools consolidated in 1921 forming the Nettle Creek School Corporation. The school district includes five and a half townships. In 1922 a new school was constructed to better accommodate the number of students in attendance. Hagerstown values enlightenment through literacy, and the public library was constructed in 1929 as a gift of the Teetor family. A new wing for the children’s department was added in 1958, and a new east wing was constructed in 1990. The library is recognized as one of the finest, especially for a community of less than 2,000 people.</p>

<p>Abbott’s Candy is another important part of Hagerstown’s history. Will Abbott was renowned in Wayne County and throughout Indiana as a candy maker. His butterscotch and carmel were becoming famous. When Will died, his son Bruce and his new wife took over operation of the family business. Bruce died shortly thereafter, and the widows of Will and Bruce continued the family business using Will’s original recipes. <span class="proof strike">In 1956, the company opened a location downtown named “The Two Sisters.”</span></p>
<p>Food is one of the primary reasons people from all over Indiana and the surrounding states come to Hagerstown. Returning from World War II, Guy “Willie” Welliver was looking to open a habadashery, but the only location was a small restaurant. Welliver planned on closing the restaurant and opening his habadashery until one evening when he was enjoying a “thrasher’s dinner” at his mother-in-law’s home. The next week at his restaurant he offered a smorgasboard meal. Patrons recognized the excellent food and unlimited choices. Soon, pan-fried chicken, shrimp, and cinnamon bread became the restaurant’s signature items. <span class="proof">The restaurant is family owned and operated, and the tradition continues today.</span></p>
<p>In 1963, the Perfect Circle Corporation was acquired by the Dana Corporation. By the 1980’s the corporation was beginning large lay-offs at the Hagerstown plant. Production ended in late 1994 or early 1995 and the plant was completely closed by 1996.</p>
