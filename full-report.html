      <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The <em>Hagerstown Comprehensive Plan</em> serves as a general framework for guiding the future development of Hagerstown. These studies outline a series of goals and recommendations for several different aspects of planning and development. Following each recommendation are strategic planning suggestions for implementing and benchmarking each recommendation.</p>
<h2>A Continuing Future</h2>
<p>The <em>Hagerstown Comprehensive Plan</em> is intended to be a “living” document and an integrated component of the ongoing planning process.</p>
<p>These studies are intended to act as a catalyst for positive and continued change in the community. Planning should be an evolving, responsive, and flexible process. The goals, recommendations, and strategies represent the concerns of many citizens and government officials who are working toward a brighter future for Hagerstown.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The <em>Hagerstown Comprehensive Plan</em> was undertaken to explore the issues currently facing Hagerstown, Indiana and to provide a guide for the future development of Hagerstopwn in the areas of economic development, housing, community development, elderly/child care, community character, and land use planning/growth management.</p>

      <h1>Area &amp; Context</h1>
<p>Hagerstown is located in Jefferson Township in western Wayne County. The town is located approximately thirteen miles west of Richmond and ten miles east of New Castle. The community is located near the crossroads of State Road 38 and State Road 1, approximately five miles north of Interstate 70. Interstate 70 is the major east-west route from Ohio to Colorado, passing through Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The town has excellent rail access via the Norfolk and Southern railroad. The line runs east/west through town. In New Castle, the tracks turn north, providing rail access to Muncie. From Muncie, goods are transported west on the line.</p>
<p>The Cardinal Greenway section of the American Discovery Trail, a rails-to- trails program eventually leading from Maryland to the Pacific Ocean, passes through Wayne County a few miles north of Hagerstown.</p>
<p>The community also has a municipal airport for small aircraft, located south east of town.</p>
<p>In 1847 the White Water Canal terminated in Hagerstown The canal had a very short life and the canal company went bankrupt in the 1860’s. The tow paths were sold to the Big Four Railroad Company. The railroad tracks were removed in 1931.</p>
<p>The Whitewater River and Nettle Creek run through the community. Nettle Creek has given its name to several elements of Hagerstown life such as the local school corporation.</p>

      <h1>History</h1>
<p>The first European settler to the Nettle Creek area was Sam Baldridge in 1814. Following his arrival, several families began to settle in the area. A church, Salem Baptist, was established in 1816, and the Church of the Brethren was organized nine years later. The first school in the area was organized northeast of what is now Hagerstown in 1828. A post office was established at Nettle Creek in 1829.</p>
<p>The area was platted as a town on March 8, 1832 by Jacob Ulrich and Jonas Harris as a real estate venture. The area was given the name of Elizabethtown after Ulrich’s daughter, but was soon changed to Hagerstown in honor of the Maryland town where many of the settlers originated. The plat was officially recorded at the state capitol at Corydon on November 15, 1832. The resolution for Hagerstown to be incorporated as a town was not passed until September 3, 1853.</p>

</div>

<p>The town faced several changes as it grew in the 19th century. By 1832 a number of businesses and mills had been established. A new post office was built at Nettle Creek in 1833, and the name officially changed to Hagerstown in 1836. The Hagerstown Canal Company was organized in 1846, with Jacob Ulrich as president. Two schools were organized for the 1846-47 school year. The earliest newspaper, the <em>Western Budget</em>, was established in 1852. A second paper, the <em>Hagerstown Journal</em>, began publication in 1865, but did not survive. The <em>Hagerstown Exponent</em> was established in 1875 by Alonzo Milton Dawson, who sold it two years later. <span class="proof">The Hagerstown Exponent remains the source of local news for the Hagerstown area</span>. In 1860 a brick school named the Hagerstown Academy was built as a permanent site for community education. A circulating library was established in 1863 in the basement of Watkin William’s Tailor Shop.</p>
<p>No history of Hagerstown would be complete without the story of the Teetor family and Perfect Circle. In 1895, Charlie Teetor changed his family bicycle repair shop to the Railway Cycle Manufacturing Company after developing a lightweight four-wheeled pedal railroad car with financing from Charles Hartley. The company began manufacturing self-propelled inspection cars and in 1900 changed names to the Light Inspection Car Company. The company took advantage of the Midwest’s movement toward automobile manufacture and began producing car engines and engine parts, including pistons and piston rings. In 1907, the company began casting the piston rings individually, creating a superior quality product. The piston rings became popular quickly, and the company changed its main production to piston rings, changing the company name to the Teetor-Hartley Motor Company and adopting the trade name of Perfect Circle.</p>
<p>The Hagerstown Telephone Company was established in 1899. The early 1900’s brought other changes in technology to Hagerstown as well. Electricity was provided in 1908, and a municipal water system was adopted in 1909.</p>
<p>The Hagerstown and Jefferson Township schools consolidated in 1921 forming the Nettle Creek School Corporation. The school district includes five and a half townships. In 1922 a new school was constructed to better accommodate the number of students in attendance. Hagerstown values enlightenment through literacy, and the public library was constructed in 1929 as a gift of the Teetor family. A new wing for the children’s department was added in 1958, and a new east wing was constructed in 1990. The library is recognized as one of the finest, especially for a community of less than 2,000 people.</p>
<div class="ph ph-image">The old Hagerstown Library</div>

<p>Abbott’s Candy is another important part of Hagerstown’s history. Will Abbott was renowned in Wayne County and throughout Indiana as a candy maker. His butterscotch and carmel were becoming famous. When Will died, his son Bruce and his new wife took over operation of the family business. Bruce died shortly thereafter, and the widows of Will and Bruce continued the family business using Will’s original recipes. <span class="proof strike">In 1956, the company opened a location downtown named “The Two Sisters.”</span></p>
<p>Food is one of the primary reasons people from all over Indiana and the surrounding states come to Hagerstown. Returning from World War II, Guy “Willie” Welliver was looking to open a habadashery, but the only location was a small restaurant. Welliver planned on closing the restaurant and opening his habadashery until one evening when he was enjoying a “thrasher’s dinner” at his mother-in-law’s home. The next week at his restaurant he offered a smorgasboard meal. Patrons recognized the excellent food and unlimited choices. Soon, pan-fried chicken, shrimp, and cinnamon bread became the restaurant’s signature items. <span class="proof">The restaurant is family owned and operated, and the tradition continues today.</span></p>
<p>In 1963, the Perfect Circle Corporation was acquired by the Dana Corporation. By the 1980’s the corporation was beginning large lay-offs at the Hagerstown plant. Production ended in late 1994 or early 1995 and the plant was completely closed by 1996.</p>

      <h1>Demographic Profile</h1>
<h2>Population</h2>
<aside>Whenever possible current data has been used. However, certain statistics are only reliable from the Census Bureau. The last Census was conducted in 2010.</aside>

<p>The official population of Hagerstown according to the 1990 Census is 1,835 persons. This six percent decline from 1980 was part of a declining population trend from 1970 to the most recent population estimate (1996). The estimated 1996 population was 1,772. The county population follows a similar declining trend, whereas the state population continues to rise.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Population Trends</div>

<p>The age figures for a particular area are a good measure of the current population structure of that area and how that area may grow in the future. Hagerstown has a high concentration of people between the ages of 45 and 54 and a high number of females between the ages of 70 and 79. Almost 60 percent of the population is between the ages of 18 and 64, which indicates that Hagerstown has a strong working age population. An additional 22 percent of the town’s population is under the age of 18 and will be of prime working age within the next two decades. This shows that Hagerstown has a strong workforce both currently and for the near future.</p>
<p>As the traditional economic base changes there will be an increasing tendency towards young families looking for a quaint bedroom community with good schools and for more senior citizens that prefer not to move.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Age by Sex in Hagerstown</div>

<h2>Households</h2>
<p>According to the 1990 Census, Hagerstown contains 807 households, most of which are single families occupied houses they owned. Children, householders and their spouses make up the largest percentage of persons in the town, accounting for 81 percent of the total population. However, for persons 65 and older (about 20 percent of the town population) the household type is much different. Over half of the members of the aged community were either householders or their spouses, but a significant number (41 percent) were non-family householders living alone. There are no elderly persons living in group quarters, such as nursing homes, since Hagerstown has none of these facilities. These statistics are typical with those of Indiana in general.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Number of Persons in Households</div>

<h2>Families and Family Type</h2>
<p>Hagerstown contains 542 families of which 84 percent are married couples. About 72.5 percent of these married couple families have no children of their own under age 18. This and the community age distribution suggests that there are a large number of empty-nesters in the community. Female householders with no male present account for over 12 percent of all families in Hagerstown, making it the next largest group after married couple families.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Family Type for Hagerstown</div>

<h2>Birthplace and Migration</h2>
<p>The majority of Hagerstown residents are native born Hoosiers. Over 80 percent of the residents were born in the state of Indiana, with the majority of people that were born out-of-state from either the southern U.S. or other parts of the midwest.</p>
<p>Slightly over half of the residents lived in the same house in 1985. Nearly 60 percent of the people who did not live in the same house in 1985 did live in Wayne County.</p>
<h2>Income and Poverty</h2>
<p>Median household income helps to show the prosperity of community residents, especially when compared to the median household income of other communities. In Hagerstown the median household income in 1989, the latest year for which data are available, was 25,428 dollars. This was greater than the median household income in Wayne County as a whole, which was 23,475 dollars, but less than the median household income for Indiana as a whole, which was 28,797 dollars. This pattern is quite common for small towns such as Hagerstown, where living expenses also are moderate.</p>
<p>The distribution of household incomes shows how many households in the community earned incomes in particular income categories. The highest ranking category in Hagerstown in 1989, the latest year for which data are available, was the 15,000 to 19,999 dollar category. Over 100 of the total 804 households in Hagerstown earned incomes in that category. The majority of households in Hagerstown earned incomes ranging from less than 5,000 dollars up to 74,999 dollars. The categories within that range were well- distributed. Only a few households in Hagerstown earned 75,000 dollars or more, though a few did range up to the 150,000 or more category. All of this suggests that Hagerstown is a relatively stable middle class community, with no significant income disparity.</p>
<p>Hagerstown is generally a prosperous community. Only nine percent of its total population earned incomes below the poverty level in 1989, the latest year for which data are available, compared to 14 percent of Wayne County’s population and ten percent of Indiana’s population. The median income may have decreased during the 1990s due to the closure of the Dana plant.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Income Distribution for Hagerstown</div>

<div class="ph ph-chart">Percentage of Persons Below Poverty Level by Age</div>

<p>Examining those persons below the poverty level by age group, however shows more about what kinds of people in each community are below the poverty level. In Hagerstown, the most prosperous residents are children aged five to 11, adults aged 35 to 44, and older adults aged 55 to 74. This makes some sense because the adults aged 35 to 44 are in their prime working years and they are probably the parents of the children aged five to 11. Some of the least prosperous residents in Hagerstown are children under five, young adults aged 18 to 34, and older adults aged 75 and over. The percentage of young adults aged 18 to 34 below the poverty level is especially troubling, and may suggest a shortage of sufficient employment opportunities in the area. These age groups are probably the parents of the children under five who are below the poverty level.</p>
<p>The percentage of persons aged 75 and over with income below the poverty level is much higher in Hagerstown than in Wayne County or Indiana as a whole. Looking at this age group more closely shows that of Hagerstown householders aged 74 and over with incomes below the poverty level, none are in married-couple families, a small percentage are female householders living alone, and the vast majority are householders living alone. Because of their income, age, and household type, this group may have special needs for programs such as health care and home maintenance.</p>
<h2>Industry</h2>
<p>In both Wayne County and Hagerstown, manufacturing was the largest sector of employment, followed by professional and related services as the second largest sector, and retail trade as the third largest sector. These three leading sectors account for approximately three-quarters of the employment in Hagerstown and Wayne County. The remaining employment sectors were evenly distributed, with three to four percent of the workforce holding jobs in these industries.</p>
<aside>Most business data is only available for the county, not for individual cities and towns. Therefore, location quotient, shift-share analysis, and employment data have been completed at the county level. Comparisons to Hagerstown are made based on anecdotal and observational data.</aside>

<div class="ph ph-chart">Occupation by Worker in Hagerstown</div>

<p>The only notable differences between Hagerstown and Indiana industry averages are in the sectors of construction and public administration; the construction sector in Hagerstown accounts for only half of the amount of the state’s average but the public administration sector accounts for five percent of Hagerstown’s employment as compared to only three percent in both the state and the county.</p>
<h2>Location Quotient</h2>
<p>Location quotient analysis is used to ascertain the export capacity of the local economy and give an indication of the degree of self-sufficiency that each individual industry possesses. Here location quotient analysis was computed for selected SIC (Standard Industrial Codes) industries in Wayne County using County Business Pattern data obtained from the Census Bureau. A location quotient that is below 1.0000 is considered a non-basic industry meaning that it normally would not export outside of the community. These industries normally function as support for industries that are exporters and are dependent upon these industries either to provide capital or to provide a consumer base for their secondary products. Those industries with a location quotient number of 1.000 of greater are considered basic industries in the fact that they normally export out of the community. In doing so they act to bring revenue into the community and provide jobs which then support the secondary non-basic businesses. The location quotient should not substitute for local knowledge of industry, however since the location quotient sometimes does not correctly state the export amount in some industries.</p>
<p>In analyzing the location quotients of 1994 employment figures compared to 1984 employment figures, there have been shifts in export capability within the manufacturing and services sectors of the Wayne County economy. The shift in manufacturing from a location quotient value of 1.1080 in 1984 to 0.8722 in 1994 is due to the loss of just under 2,000 jobs in Wayne County and a gain of over 40,000 jobs in the Indiana economy. Although manufacturing almost undoubtedly exports its products outside of the county, the location quotient means that Wayne County has less manufacturing jobs per capita than the state. Much of this shift occurred in the industrial machinery and equipment industry classification (SIC 35) as jobs decreased from 2,037 in 1984 with a location quotient of 2.3406 to 695 jobs in 1994 with a location quotient of 0.9476.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Location Quotient for Wayne County</div>

<p>The services sector of Wayne County’s economy has seen a major increase in employment since 1984 with an increase of just over 5,000 jobs. This has increased the location quotient from 0.9538 in 1984 to 1.2291 in 1994 indicating some industries within the service sector are either exporting or creating more employment opportunities per capita than elsewhere in Indiana. When looking at major industrial classifications within the services sector there has been a large increase within business services (SIC 73) with employment rising from 361 in 1984 with a location quotient of 0.5350 to 3,000 in 1994 with a location quotient of 2.3031.</p>
<p>The location quotient figures for Wayne County for 1990 show that there are several sectors which are considered basic industries. Several of the service sectors, including professional, health, and business services have location quotients greater than one, indicating that these sectors are exported from the community. Public administration, manufacturing of durable goods, and retail trade are also basic sectors in the Wayne County economy. These location quotient figures show that Wayne County has a strong economy, with several sectors exporting outside the community. However, as mentioned previously, the location quotient should not be relied upon as the only indicator of the economy. In comparing these figures to Wayne County, it is important to note that only a small percentage of Wayne County employees work in Hagerstown. However, based on observations made on field visits and interviews with local residents, the same trends seem to apply.</p>
<h2>Shift-Share</h2>
<p>To augment location quotient data one must also consider shift share analysis. This is a useful tool for analyzing the change in the structure of the local economy in reference to the State of Indiana as a whole. This takes into account job performance or productivity of each industry and gives information on the proportional shift (which is the rate of growth of the individual sector in the state) and the differential shift (which is used to ascertain the competitive advantage of local industry). By measuring the rate of growth of the local industries and comparing it to growth rates statewide, a positive differential shift would indicate that the local industry is growing faster than similar industries statewide.</p>
<p>In analyzing Wayne County’s shift share, it is interesting to note that there has been a large reduction in the county’s competitive advantage in the manufacturing sector with employment falling from 9,074 in 1984 to 7,087 in 1994 and the differential shift being -0.2909 and the proportional shift being -0.2479. This means that manufacturing in the Indiana economy has contracted although Wayne County’s manufacturing sector’s competitive advantage is much below that of the state on average. Wayne County has enjoyed growth in the services sector with an increase of just over 5,000 jobs and a differential shift of 0.3306 meaning this is a relatively competitive sector for Wayne County.</p>
<p>In examining major industrial classifications, Wayne County has major competitive advantages in trucking and warehousing (SIC 42), where employment has increased from 154 in 1984 to 812 in 1994 with a differential shift of 3.5780, and business services (SIC 73), where employment has increased from 361 in 1984 to 3,000 in 1994 with a differential shift of 6.2247. These high differential shifts indicate an extreme competitive advantage for Wayne County in these industries. As with Location Quotient, it is important to note that only a small percentage of Wayne County employees work in Hagerstown. Based on observational and anecdotal evidence, Hagerstown seems to have mirrored the country’s loss in manufacturing. Hagerstown appears to enjoy a competitive advantage in retail.</p>
<h2>Employment and Unemployment</h2>
<p>The unemployment rate of Wayne County has followed historical trends nationwide but has generally remained higher than the average Indiana unemployment rate. During the early 1980s and the early 1990s the recessions that affected the United States were more sharply apparent in Wayne County, when unemployment rates reached peaks of 14.7 percent and 12.5 percent. Indiana averages were affected by these economic recessions to a lesser degree than Wayne County, which can be explained by the high percentage of workers employed in retail trade and manufacturing; these sectors are generally responsive to larger economic conditions and therefore would experience a greater setback from an economic recession. This may show a need to diversify the employment base in Wayne County and in Hagerstown to avoid high unemployment during future economic recessions.</p>

      <h1>Education</h1>
<p>According to the 1990 U.S. Census, Hagerstown residents on average attained higher levels of education than the average Indiana resident. Over 80 percent of Hagerstown residents age 25 and older have at least a high school diploma and nearly half of these graduates have some kind of post secondary education. High school graduates account for less than 75 percent of all Indiana residents; therefore, Hagerstown has a significantly higher educational attainment level than the average Indiana resident. Wayne County had a much lower rate of high school graduates than both the Indiana averages and the Hagerstown averages. These educational attainment figures show that Hagerstown has a well-educated population which helps make the residents highly employable in higher quality jobs.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Educational Attainment</div>

<p>The Nettle Creek School Corporation, which serves the residents of Hagerstown, ranks above state average in many areas, according to data provided by the Indiana Department to Education. Nettle Creek had a higher attendance rate (96.2 percent) and a higher graduation rate (91.0 percent) than Indiana averages during the 1996-97 school year. The school corporation also had a higher percentage of 12th graders taking the SAT in 1997 (60 percent compared to 52 percent for Indiana) and a lower rate of suspension and explusion in 1997 (15.6 percent compared to 29.0 percent in Indiana). All of the figures begin to give an indication of the high quality of schools available in Hagerstown.</p>
<p>One way to evaluate the performance of a particular school corporation is to examine the standardized test scores such as the ISTEP and the SAT obtained by that corporation’s students. Through the early 1990s, Nettle Creek’s average combined SAT score was usually below Indiana averages and always below United States averages. The greatest gap between the Nettle Creek and Indiana scores occurred during the 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 academic years when the average combined score dropped to 799, over 70 points lower than Indiana averages during those years. The following two academic years saw major increases in combined SAT scores in the Nettle Creek School Corporation. The increase in the 1995-1996 academic year does reflect changes in the SAT testing procedure, but Nettle Creek’s score, although slightly below national averages, did exceed state averages.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Percentage Above Indiana Academic Standards Based on 1997-98 ISTEP Scores</div>

<p>The Indiana Department of Education sets a standard level of achievement for the Indiana Standardized Test of Educational Progress (ISTEP) for each grade level that participates in the testing. The 1997-1998 ISTEP results showed that Nettle Creek students placed above these Indiana academic standards overall. At least half, and in most cases well over half, of the students scored above the standards in all areas. Nettle Creek generally scored about the same as the average Indiana student. Indiana students were much stronger in English than in math and Nettle Creek amplified this trend by scoring slightly higher than the average Indiana student in English tests and slightly lower in math tests.</p>
<p>The most current enrollment figures projections released by the Indiana Department of Education show that the Nettle Creek School Corporation had 1265 students during the 1997-1998 academic year. The total enrollment increased slightly during the 1990s but is expected to decrease in the next five years. As the larger groups of students work their way through the higher grade levels, elementary enrollment is expected to decrease and secondary enrollment is projected to increase.</p>

      <h1>Housing</h1>
<p>There are 865 housing units in Hagerstown. Ninety-three percent are occupied and seven percent are vacant, the same percentages as for Wayne County as a whole and about the same as for the state of Indiana as a whole. Of those Hagerstown housing units which are occupied, 69 percent are occupied by owners and 31 percent by renters. These percentages also are very similar to those for the county and state.</p>
<p>Examining the age of householders, the percentages of occupied housing units with householders in each age group are generally about the same for Hagerstown as for Wayne County and Indiana. The exception is in the age group of householders 75 and over, where Hagerstown has more householders by far than the county or state. This is true for both owners and renters. It suggests that even at age 75 or older, Hagerstown residents are able to be the head of their household, but also that there are no real alternatives. However, the high number of these older householders supports other observations about the possible need for home maintenance programs for this group, or for alternative forms of housing that require lower maintenance. These needs were frequently mentioned in interviews with community residents.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Owner Occupied Housing Units by Age of Householder</div>

<p>The percentage of households by number of units per structure shows the composition of the community’s housing stock. In Hagerstown, as in the county and state as a whole, the vast majority of housing is single family detached housing units. Slightly more of the housing in Hagerstown than in the county or state is of this type. Hagerstown has more two-family homes, or doubles (also called duplexes), than the county or state, but less mobile homes or trailers than the county and state. Hagerstown also has slightly more small multi-family buildings (three to nine dwelling units), but fewer large multi- family buildings (ten or more dwelling units).</p>
<p>More of Hagerstown single family detached housing units are owned and less are rented than in the county or state as a whole, but more of Hagerstown two- family housing units are rented. This may suggest that doubles are an acceptable form of rental housing in Hagerstown.</p>
<p>Housing units in Hagerstown are generally older than in the county or state as a whole. Hagerstown has more housing units built before 1959, and less built after 1959. This suggests housing may be in need of repair or upgrading, a fact reinforced by site visits and interviews with community residents.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Percentage of Housing Units by Year Structure Built</div>

<p>The median value of all owner-occupied housing in Hagerstown in 1990, the latest year for which data are available, was $44,500, which was higher than the Wayne County median housing value of 42,220 dollars, but lower than the Indiana median housing value of $53,500. This is the same pattern as median household income, which is typical. The distribution of housing units in different value categories shows that the majority of housing in Hagerstown was valued in the $25,000 to $74,99 range.</p>
<p>Community residents were concerned that new housing going in is more expensive, and that there is a lack of housing available in all price ranges.</p>

      <h1>Transportation</h1>
<p>Eighty percent of the workers in Hagerstown held jobs in Wayne County; an additional 18 percent of the workforce held jobs inside Indiana but outside of Wayne County. Only one percent of Hagerstown’s workforce worked outside of the state. More Hagerstown workers were employed in Wayne County than the Indiana averages for workers remaining in their county of residence. When a large percentage of the workforce remains inside its county of residence for employment, travel times to work are reduced. Travel times may have increased during the 1990s as more Hagerstown residents needed to find employment outside of town.</p>
<p>Of the Hagerstown residents working within Wayne County, 54 percent remained in the town to work and the other 46 percent worked elsewhere in the county. The high percentage of workers employed in town shows that Hagerstown has a fairly healthy employment base; this figure shows that most workers can find jobs they need in town instead of looking elsewhere. As noted above, colloquial evidence suggests that more Hagerstown residents may work out of town now than in 1989.</p>
<p>As more new homes are built these will tend to be occupied by commuters which will change the character of the community as well as increasing traffic patterns.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Place of Work</div>

<p>Commuting patterns show that most Hagerstown residents who work outside of their homes travel less than 20 minutes to reach their place of employment. The median travel times to work for Hagerstown, Wayne County, and Indiana are 19.9, 16.1, and 20.4 minutes, respectively.</p>

      <h1>Land Use</h1>
<p>An inventory of the current land uses in Hagerstown is useful in making future land use decisions and changes to development ordinances. Land uses are typically divided in to several categories: residential, commercial and business, industrial, public and quasi-public, farmland, and undeveloped land.</p>
<h2>Residential</h2>
<p>Residential uses currently occupy the most land area in Hagerstown. The majority of the housing is single family detached units, developed in to neighborhood blocks. A limited number of higher density residences are available.</p>
<h2>Commercial and Business</h2>
<p>Downtown Hagerstown and the SR 38 corridor are devoted to primarily government and commercial uses. Commercial and business uses occupy only a small percentage of land in Hagerstown, and are focused in the downtown area, but there are some segments of sprawl east towards SR1. This has a negative image for the community, causes congestion, and is more expensive to service. Part of Hagerstown’s charm and character comes from its pedestrian friendly downtown.</p>
<h2>Industrial</h2>
<p>Industrial land occupies the most land area in Hagerstown following residential uses. There are three industrial parks, an unusually high number for a small town. Small towns should be aware that industrial land should be provided only to the extent that infrastructure support and access is available. Several communities in Indiana have excessive land zoned for industrial uses for which adequate infrastructure support is not available. Currently the industrial areas are under utilized.</p>
<h2>Public and Quasi-public</h2>
<p>Public land uses in Hagerstown include the schools, library, municipal buildings, cemetery, water treatment plant, post office, and the parks. Quasi- public uses are those which are held by a corporation or organization for the provision of public services. In Hagerstown these include the utility companies and churches, as well as the Optimist Club athletic park.</p>
<h2>Farmland</h2>
<p>Agricultural land uses are important to Hagerstown and Jefferson Township. Prime farmland should be treated as a legitimate land use, rather than undeveloped land, to protect agricultural resources from development pressure. Much of the land in Jefferson Township (within the Hagerstown zoning fringe) is appropriately used for agriculture.</p>
<h2>Undeveloped</h2>
<p>This is land that for whatever reason has no current use. Some of the land is too poorly drained for development or has topographical limitations, and some is non-prime farmland that may be suitable for development. Some of the undeveloped land in Hagerstown is zoned for uses which are not currently in demand. Much of the undeveloped land is suitable for development at some time in the future.</p>

      <h1>Push-Pull Factors</h1>
<aside>
  <h3>Pull Factors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Interstate development</li>
    <li>Community character</li>
    <li>Tourism</li>
    <li>Access to other cities</li>

  </ul>
</aside>

<p>There are factors within communities that can act to repel, attract, or both. Pull factors are advantages on which the community can build the future. Push factors are those that must be overcome in order to meet the community’s goals. Communities have the ability to exploit the pull factors and minimize the push factors once they have been identified and the community makes a commitment to reaching its goals.</p>
<h2>Pull Factors</h2>
<p>The strong advantages on which Hagerstown can build a firm planning base are its pull factors. These factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interstate development at the I-70 interchange – Although plans have been progressing slower than anticipated, development at the interstate interchanges could provide for a more sound tourism industry. There may be other benefits as well. However, this type of development frequently encourages sprawling development from communities out to the interchange development. It is also infrastructure intensive.</li>
<li>Community character – Hagerstown has a truly unique and interesting small town character. It is attractive to residents and visitors alike. A number of downtown and community improvements could enhance this character so that the town’s full tourism potential can be recognized.</li>
<li>Tourism – A tourism base already exists in Hagerstown with thousands of visitors each year coming to eat at Welliver’s and enjoy shopping at Abbott’s Candy and the local antique and craft shops. If combined into tour packages including visiting Amish farms, traditional homesteads, local museums, and other attractions of the county the tourism industry could provide a strong economic base for Hagerstown.</li>
<li>Access to other cities – The convenient access to Richmond, New Castle, Muncie, Indianapolis, Dayton and other cities makes Hagerstown an ideal location for people to want to live. It also makes a good transhipment point for warehousing and other industries. There are problems associated with this level of access as well; these are discussed as push factors.</li>
<li>Good community parks – Hagerstown has excellent community park facilities. These facilities are used and enjoyed primarily by community residents. Expanding the parks into a parks system and developing additional recreation opportunities will enhance the quality of life in Hagerstown.</li>
<li>Amish population – while the Amish are new to the Hagerstown area, there already appears to be a growing relationship between the Amish and non-Amish communities. There is potential for tourism development, locally produced goods, and other activities involving the emerging Amish community.</li>
<li>Little/no town debt – the town has been fortunate enough to avoid an accumulation of debt. This leaves the town in a stable financial position from which it can make decisions about the financing of new projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Push Factors</h2>
<p>The challenges that detract from Hagerstown’s vitality are the pull factors. They can be mitigated to enhance the quality of life in the community. These factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of strong industrial base – Dana Corporation leaving Hagerstown left the town without a strong industrial base. This has caused a number of residents to find employment in the surrounding communities. There is potential for development of a new industrial base of small businesses, local value added industries, and others that don’t have some of the problems of a single, large, auto industry employment base.</li>
<li>Lack of available housing/age and maintenance of existing housing stock – There is not a lot of housing available for new residents and the housing stock is of the same relative size and style. The lack of housing and housing variety discourages new residents and new business. Much of the housing in the community is aging, and some is in need of maintenance or renovation. This is a deterrent to tourism, new residents, and new business and industry.</li>
<li>Access to other cities – The close proximity of other communities is encouraging Hagerstown to become a bedroom community. This type of community lacks the tax base and other resources to provide for many of the community services that Hagerstown residents value. It also leads to traffic problems and sprawling development between the bedroom community and the employment base. Redeveloping a local economic base would allow more residents to work in the community and provide the tax base necessary to support a high level of community services.</li>
<li>The Dana building/environmental problems – the Dana site is on a lengthy environmental clean up schedule due to the lack of regard for resources that was associated with previous decades and the rust belt industries. The site has potential for reuse if the environmental problems can be mitigated in a more timely fashion than the current schedule provides. New industrial sites should meet certain criteria or performance standards to reduce the potential for future environmental problems.</li>
<li>Hagerstown’s aging population – While the older members of the community have been valuable lifelong assets to the community, there are problems associated with an aging population. Older residents are no longer contributing to the community’s economic base, in terms of employment and earned income taxes. Older residents also have a need for age appropriate housing and special help with home maintenance. There are also health care issues associated with older residents. Many are in need of more professional health care than is available in Hagerstown.</li>
<li>Leapfrog and sprawling development – The development of subdivisions, housing lots, commercial and industrial developments that are not adjacent to other development in the community is land consumptive and burdens local infrastructure. The extra capacity spent on sprawling new development could be used for the upgrade of existing services to better serve development that is adjacent to other development. Also, since most newer residents work elsewhere, this begins to make Hagerstown more of a bedroom community, increasing traffic congestion, and reducing community character.</li>
