      <h1>Mandate</h1>
<p>Indiana statute, Title 36, Article 7, as amended, empowers towns and cities to plan.  This mandate encourages towns “to improve the health, safety, convenience, and welfare of their citizens and to plan for the future development of their communities” (IC 36-7-4-201).  In exercising planning and zoning, towns should:
- Carefully plan highway systems
- Grow only with adequate public way, utility, health, educational, and recreational facilities
- Recognize the needs of agriculture, forestry, industry, and business in future growth
- Provide residential areas with healthful surroundings for family life
- Ensure that the growth of the community is commensurate with and promotive of the efficient and economical use of public funds</p>
<p>IC 36-7-4-201 also provides for the establishment of “single and unified planning and zoning entities.” </p>
<p>Town planning commissions are charged with preparing a comprehensive plan (IC 36-7-4-501).  Comprehensive plans must include: </p>
<ul>
<li>A statement of objectives for the future development of the jurisdiction</li>
<li>A statement of policy for the land use development of the jurisdiction</li>
<li>A statement of policy for the development of public ways, public places, public lands, public structures, and public utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>This plan thus intends to fulfill Indiana state statutes regarding town planning as well as provide the town of Hagerstown with a useful tool for the future.</p>

      <h1>History</h1>
<h2>Area &amp; Context</h2>
<p>Hagerstown is situated in Jefferson Township in western Wayne County.  Located approximately thirteen miles west of Richmond and ten miles east of New Castle, the community sits near the intersection of State Road 38 and State Road 1.  Hagerstown is approximately five miles north of Interstate 70, and the town has rail access via the Norfolk and Southern railroad.  The Hagerstown Airport also services the community and can accommodate small aircraft.  </p>
<p>The Cardinal Greenway section of the American Discovery Trail, a rails-to-trails program intended to eventually stretch from Maryland to the Pacific Ocean, passes through Wayne County a few miles north of Hagerstown.</p>
<p>Both Whitewater River and Nettle Creek run through the community, with Nettle Creek feeding into Scout Lake just south of town. In the nineteenth century Hagerstown was the northern terminus of the White Water Canal, a major canal system which spanned seventy-six miles and was completed in 1847.  Today, many elements of Hagerstown life have taken on the name of Nettle Creek, including the Nettle Creek School Corporation and the Nettle Creek Gazette. </p>
<div class="ph ph-map"><strong>Context map including Hagerstown and the surrounding area.</strong></div>


<h2>Early History</h2>
<p>The Treaty of Greenville between the federal government and the Native Americans of the Western Confederacy was signed in 1795, and this treaty first opened the eastern part of present-day Wayne County to settlers.  In 1809, the Twelve Mile Purchase pushed the edge of U.S. territory twelve miles farther west, drawing the boundary east of where Hagerstown lies today.  Treaty Line Road, just south of Hagerstown, still runs along this 1809 treaty line.  Though settlers began to move into the area by 1814, the land in and around present-day Hagerstown was not officially open for sale until after 1822.</p>
<p>In 1830, Jacob Ulrich began to sell off lots in the area of present-day Hagerstown, calling this new venture Elizabethtown after his daughter.  On March 8, 1932, Ulrich and Jonas Harris laid out the town and renamed it Hagerstown.  Hagerstown was surveyed and platted November 15, 1832, and Jefferson Township was formed in 1834.  Hagerstown was incorporated as a town on September 3, 1853. </p>
<p>Early churches included a Salem Baptist Church, established in 1816, and the Church of the Brethren, organized in 1825.  The first school in the area was organized northeast of present-day Hagerstown in 1828.  The Nettle Creek Post Office was established in 1829. </p>
<p>The town continued to grow throughout the nineteenth century.  By 1832 a number of businesses and mills had been established, and a new post office was built at Nettle Creek in 1833.  The Hagerstown Canal Company was organized in 1846, with Jacob Ulrich as president. </p>
<p>The town’s earliest newspaper, the <em>Western Budget</em>, was established in 1852. A second paper, the <em>Hagerstown Journal</em>, began publication in 1865, but did not survive. Finally, the <em>Hagerstown Exponent</em> was established in 1875 by Alonzo Milton Dawson. The <em>Exponent</em> remained the source of local news for the Hagerstown area into the twenty-first century.  Today, the community is served by the <em>Nettle Creek Gazette</em>. </p>
<p>In 1860 the Hagerstown Academy was built as a permanent site for community education, and in 1863 a circulating library was formed in the basement of Watkin William’s Tailor Shop.  </p>
<p>The Hagerstown Telephone Company was established in 1899. Electricity was provided to the town in 1908, and a municipal water system was adopted in 1909.</p>
<h2>Growth and Development in the Twentieth Century</h2>
<p>The town expanded quickly in the early twentieth century, and with new business opportunities came a need for greater educational resources.  In 1921 the Hagerstown and Jefferson Township schools consolidated, forming the Nettle Creek School Corporation. Several more townships would consolidate into the school system in 1962, resulting in the building of a new elementary and high school in 1968 and 1971, respectively.  In 1929 the Teetor family gifted the new Jefferson Township Public Library to the town. Two new wings were added to the building in 1958 and 1990, and the library continues to serve as a central hub of town life today.  The Hagerstown Museum and Arts Place, located in a historic building on Main Street, also furthers community education through its preservation of local history and offerings of fine arts classes.</p>
<p>Businesses such as Perfect Circle, Abbott’s Candy, and Welliver’s Smorgasbord have also left a lasting impression on the Hagerstown community.  The history of Perfect Circle begins with the Teetor family in 1895, when, after developing a lightweight four-wheeled pedal railroad car, Charles Teetor transformed his family bicycle repair shop into the Railway Cycle Manufacturing Company.  The company began manufacturing self-propelled inspection cars, and in 1900 was renamed the Light Inspection Car Company. Taking advantage of the Midwest’s movement toward automobile manufacture, the company began producing car engines and engine parts.  In 1907 Teetor’s business began casting piston rings individually, resulting in a superior quality product which quickly became popular.  The company’s name changed once again, this time to the Teetor-Hartley Motor Company; it also adopted the trade name of Perfect Circle. The Dana Corporation bought Perfect Circle in 1963, and the plant closed in 1995. Ralph Teetor, Charles’ nephew, founded TEDCO (Teetor Engineering Development Company), which today manufactures gyroscopes and educational toys in Hagerstown. Ralph Teetor also invented the Speedostat, or cruise control, for use on automobiles.  </p>
<p>The automobile has continued to leave its mark on Hagerstown business and industry, as both Autocar and Precision Wire call the town home.  Autocar, the nation’s oldest vehicle nameplate and a leading manufacturer of LCF Class 8 refuse trucks, opened its headquarters in Hagerstown in 2003.  Precision Wire Assemblies, Inc., assembles wire harnesses at its plant in Hagerstown.</p>
<p>Abbott’s Candy is another important business in Hagerstown’s history. In 1897, William Clay Abbott sold his Hagerstown restaurant to become a traveling salesman for the candy makers Dilling &amp; Company.  After some time, he returned to Hagerstown and began to make and sell his own candy, turning the garage behind his home into a candy factory.  Abbott’s candies, particularly his caramels and butterscotch, became locally famous.  After William’s death in 1942, his son, J. Bruce Abbott, and widow, Florence Abbott, continued the candy-making tradition.  Bruce first introduced mechanization to the process, but his death in 1949 left Florence and Bruce’s widow, Rhea, to take over the candy business.  Rhea introduced further mechanization to the factory, and in 1956 the women opened The Two Sisters gift shop on Main Street.  Rhea’s daughter, Suanna Abbott Goodnight, took over the business after her mother’s death in 1988.  Jay and Lynn Noel recently acquired the business, and have opened two additional locations in Indianapolis. </p>
<p>Finally, Hagerstown is perhaps most well-known in the area for its local smorgasbord restaurant.  After returning from World War II, Guy “Willie” Welliver sought to open a haberdashery on Main Street.  After purchasing a location on Main Street—which was, at the time, set up as a restaurant—Welliver attended a “thrasher’s dinner” at his mother-in-law’s home.  The following week he decided to offer a similar smorgasbord meal in his newly-acquired business.  The restaurant was a success, and pan-fried chicken, shrimp, and cinnamon bread became a few of its signature items. Welliver’s Famous Smorgasbord remained family-owned until 2010, when it was purchased by local business owners Mike and Penny Wicks.  After surviving a fire and subsequent renovations, the restaurant reopened as Willie and Red’s and continues to draw patrons with its extensive smorgasbord and menu options.</p>

      <h1>Industry &amp; Employment</h1>
<p>The unemployment rate of Wayne County has followed historical trends nationwide but has generally remained higher than the average Indiana unemployment rate. During the early 1980s and the early 1990s the recessions that affected the United States were more sharply apparent in Wayne County, when unemployment rates reached peaks of 14.7 percent and 12.5 percent. Indiana averages were affected by these economic recessions to a lesser degree than Wayne County, which can be explained by the high percentage of workers employed in retail trade and manufacturing; these sectors are generally responsive to larger economic conditions and therefore would experience a greater setback from an economic recession. This may show a need to diversify the employment base in Wayne County and in Hagerstown to avoid high unemployment during future economic recessions.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Unemployment Rates</div>
    </div>

  <article class="main">
    <div class="wrapper">
      <h1>Education</h1>
<p>According to the 1990 U.S. Census, Hagerstown residents on average attained higher levels of education than the average Indiana resident. Over 80 percent of Hagerstown residents age 25 and older have at least a high school diploma and nearly half of these graduates have some kind of post secondary education. High school graduates account for less than 75 percent of all Indiana residents; therefore, Hagerstown has a significantly higher educational attainment level than the average Indiana resident. Wayne County had a much lower rate of high school graduates than both the Indiana averages and the Hagerstown averages. These educational attainment figures show that Hagerstown has a well-educated population which helps make the residents highly employable in higher quality jobs.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Educational Attainment</div>

<p>The Nettle Creek School Corporation, which serves the residents of Hagerstown, ranks above state average in many areas, according to data provided by the Indiana Department to Education. Nettle Creek had a higher attendance rate (96.2 percent) and a higher graduation rate (91.0 percent) than Indiana averages during the 1996-97 school year. The school corporation also had a higher percentage of 12th graders taking the SAT in 1997 (60 percent compared to 52 percent for Indiana) and a lower rate of suspension and explusion in 1997 (15.6 percent compared to 29.0 percent in Indiana). All of the figures begin to give an indication of the high quality of schools available in Hagerstown.</p>
<p>One way to evaluate the performance of a particular school corporation is to examine the standardized test scores such as the ISTEP and the SAT obtained by that corporation’s students. Through the early 1990s, Nettle Creek’s average combined SAT score was usually below Indiana averages and always below United States averages. The greatest gap between the Nettle Creek and Indiana scores occurred during the 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 academic years when the average combined score dropped to 799, over 70 points lower than Indiana averages during those years. The following two academic years saw major increases in combined SAT scores in the Nettle Creek School Corporation. The increase in the 1995-1996 academic year does reflect changes in the SAT testing procedure, but Nettle Creek’s score, although slightly below national averages, did exceed state averages.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Percentage Above Indiana Academic Standards Based on 1997-98 ISTEP Scores</div>

<p>The Indiana Department of Education sets a standard level of achievement for the Indiana Standardized Test of Educational Progress (ISTEP) for each grade level that participates in the testing. The 1997-1998 ISTEP results showed that Nettle Creek students placed above these Indiana academic standards overall. At least half, and in most cases well over half, of the students scored above the standards in all areas. Nettle Creek generally scored about the same as the average Indiana student. Indiana students were much stronger in English than in math and Nettle Creek amplified this trend by scoring slightly higher than the average Indiana student in English tests and slightly lower in math tests.</p>
<p>The most current enrollment figures projections released by the Indiana Department of Education show that the Nettle Creek School Corporation had 1265 students during the 1997-1998 academic year. The total enrollment increased slightly during the 1990s but is expected to decrease in the next five years. As the larger groups of students work their way through the higher grade levels, elementary enrollment is expected to decrease and secondary enrollment is projected to increase.</p>

      <h1>Housing</h1>
<p>According to the 1990 Census, Hagerstown contains 807 households, most of which are single families occupied houses they owned. Children, householders and their spouses make up the largest percentage of persons in the town, accounting for 81 percent of the total population. However, for persons 65 and older (about 20 percent of the town population) the household type is much different. Over half of the members of the aged community were either householders or their spouses, but a significant number (41 percent) were non-family householders living alone. There are no elderly persons living in group quarters, such as nursing homes, since Hagerstown has none of these facilities. These statistics are typical with those of Indiana in general.</p>

      <h1>Housing</h1>
<p>There are 865 housing units in Hagerstown. Ninety-three percent are occupied and seven percent are vacant, the same percentages as for Wayne County as a whole and about the same as for the state of Indiana as a whole. Of those Hagerstown housing units which are occupied, 69 percent are occupied by owners and 31 percent by renters. These percentages also are very similar to those for the county and state.</p>
<p>Examining the age of householders, the percentages of occupied housing units with householders in each age group are generally about the same for Hagerstown as for Wayne County and Indiana. The exception is in the age group of householders 75 and over, where Hagerstown has more householders by far than the county or state. This is true for both owners and renters. It suggests that even at age 75 or older, Hagerstown residents are able to be the head of their household, but also that there are no real alternatives. However, the high number of these older householders supports other observations about the possible need for home maintenance programs for this group, or for alternative forms of housing that require lower maintenance. These needs were frequently mentioned in interviews with community residents.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Owner Occupied Housing Units by Age of Householder</div>

<p>The percentage of households by number of units per structure shows the composition of the community’s housing stock. In Hagerstown, as in the county and state as a whole, the vast majority of housing is single family detached housing units. Slightly more of the housing in Hagerstown than in the county or state is of this type. Hagerstown has more two-family homes, or doubles (also called duplexes), than the county or state, but less mobile homes or trailers than the county and state. Hagerstown also has slightly more small multi-family buildings (three to nine dwelling units), but fewer large multi- family buildings (ten or more dwelling units).</p>
<p>More of Hagerstown single family detached housing units are owned and less are rented than in the county or state as a whole, but more of Hagerstown two- family housing units are rented. This may suggest that doubles are an acceptable form of rental housing in Hagerstown.</p>
<p>Housing units in Hagerstown are generally older than in the county or state as a whole. Hagerstown has more housing units built before 1959, and less built after 1959. This suggests housing may be in need of repair or upgrading, a fact reinforced by site visits and interviews with community residents.</p>
<div class="ph ph-chart">Percentage of Housing Units by Year Structure Built</div>

<p>The median value of all owner-occupied housing in Hagerstown in 1990, the latest year for which data are available, was $44,500, which was higher than the Wayne County median housing value of 42,220 dollars, but lower than the Indiana median housing value of $53,500. This is the same pattern as median household income, which is typical. The distribution of housing units in different value categories shows that the majority of housing in Hagerstown was valued in the $25,000 to $74,99 range.</p>
<p>Community residents were concerned that new housing going in is more expensive, and that there is a lack of housing available in all price ranges.</p>

      <h1>Land Use Planning</h1>
<p>An inventory of the current land uses in Hagerstown is useful in making future land use decisions and changes to development ordinances. Land uses are typically divided in to several categories: residential, commercial and business, industrial, public and quasi-public, farmland, and undeveloped land.</p>
<h2>Residential</h2>
<p>Residential uses currently occupy the most land area in Hagerstown. The majority of the housing is single family detached units, developed in to neighborhood blocks. A limited number of higher density residences are available.</p>
<h2>Commercial and Business</h2>
<p>Downtown Hagerstown and the SR 38 corridor are devoted to primarily government and commercial uses. Commercial and business uses occupy only a small percentage of land in Hagerstown, and are focused in the downtown area, but there are some segments of sprawl east towards SR1. This has a negative image for the community, causes congestion, and is more expensive to service. Part of Hagerstown’s charm and character comes from its pedestrian friendly downtown.</p>
<h2>Industrial</h2>
<p>Industrial land occupies the most land area in Hagerstown following residential uses. There are three industrial parks, an unusually high number for a small town. Small towns should be aware that industrial land should be provided only to the extent that infrastructure support and access is available. Several communities in Indiana have excessive land zoned for industrial uses for which adequate infrastructure support is not available. Currently the industrial areas are under utilized.</p>
<h2>Public and Quasi-public</h2>
<p>Public land uses in Hagerstown include the schools, library, municipal buildings, cemetery, water treatment plant, post office, and the parks. Quasi- public uses are those which are held by a corporation or organization for the provision of public services. In Hagerstown these include the utility companies and churches, as well as the Optimist Club athletic park.</p>
<h2>Farmland</h2>
<p>Agricultural land uses are important to Hagerstown and Jefferson Township. Prime farmland should be treated as a legitimate land use, rather than undeveloped land, to protect agricultural resources from development pressure. Much of the land in Jefferson Township (within the Hagerstown zoning fringe) is appropriately used for agriculture.</p>
<h2>Undeveloped</h2>
<p>This is land that for whatever reason has no current use. Some of the land is too poorly drained for development or has topographical limitations, and some is non-prime farmland that may be suitable for development. Some of the undeveloped land in Hagerstown is zoned for uses which are not currently in demand. Much of the undeveloped land is suitable for development at some time in the future.</p>
